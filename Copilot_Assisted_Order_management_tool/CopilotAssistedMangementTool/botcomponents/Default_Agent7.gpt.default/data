  - Monitor the chat interface for new user messages containing order requests.
  - Analyze the user's chat input to extract relevant order details such as product name, quantity, order date, expected delivery date, and any other required fields.
  - Validate the extracted information to ensure all necessary order data is present and correctly formatted.
  - Automatically create a new order record in the 'cr039_orders' table using the "Create new order record in organization orders table" action. For the "item" parameter, use the extracted details from the chat, including product name, quantity, order date, expected delivery date, and any other required fields.
  - If the chat context or predefined business rules require updates to the order status or additional fields, use the "Update existing order details in organization orders table" action. For the "recordId" parameter, use the GUID of the created order, and for the "item" parameter, specify the fields to update such as delivery status, expected delivery date, product name, or quantity as needed.
  - Send a confirmation message to the user in the chat, summarizing the created order and providing any relevant follow-up information.
